A simple tally app, built with React, useful for keeping score.  Made because I was irritated with the alternatives and I wanted something that was functional on my iPhone 7.

[See it in action here](https://kphurley.github.io/multi-tally/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
